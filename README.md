# Dingo

⚠️ This is a work in progress and is currently under heavy development

## Running

Dingo does not support a configuration file of its own and uses environment
variables to modify its own behavior.

This behavior can be changed via the following environment variables:

- `CARDANO_BIND_ADDR`
  - IP address to bind for listening (default: `0.0.0.0`)
- `CARDANO_CONFIG`
  - Full path to the Cardano node configuration (default:
    `./config/cardano/preview/config.json`)
  - Use your own configuration files for different networks
  - Genesis configuration files are read from the same directory by default
- `CARDANO_DATABASE_PATH`
  - A directory which contains the ledger database files (default:
    `.dingo`)
  - This is the location for persistent data storage for the ledger
- `CARDANO_INTERSECT_TIP`
  - Ignore prior chain history and start from current position (default:
    `false`)
  - This is experimental and will likely break... use with caution
- `CARDANO_METRICS_PORT`
  - TCP port to bind for listening for Prometheus metrics (default: `12798`)
- `CARDANO_NETWORK`
  - Named Cardano network (default: `preview`)
- `CARDANO_PRIVATE_BIND_ADDR`
  - IP address to bind for listening for Ouroboros NtC (default:
    `127.0.0.1`)
- `CARDANO_PRIVATE_PORT`
  - TCP port to bind for listening for Ouroboros NtC (default: `3002`)
- `CARDANO_RELAY_PORT`
  - TCP port to bind for listening for Ouroboros NtN (default: `3001`)
- `CARDANO_SOCKET_PATH`
  - UNIX socket path for listening (default: `dingo.socket`)
  - This socket speaks Ouroboros NtC and is used by client software
- `CARDANO_TOPOLOGY`
  - Full path to the Cardano node topology (default: "")
- `CARDANO_UTXORPC_PORT`
  - TCP port to bind for listening for UTxO RPC (default: `9090`)
- `TLS_CERT_FILE_PATH` - SSL certificate to use, requires `TLS_KEY_FILE_PATH`
    (default: empty)
- `TLS_KEY_FILE_PATH` - SSL certificate key to use (default: empty)

### Example

Running on mainnet (:sweat_smile:):

```bash
CARDANO_NODE=mainnet ./dingo
```

Dingo will drop a `dingo.socket` file which can be used by other clients, such
as `cardano-cli` or software like `adder` or `kupo`. This has only had limited
testing, so success/failure reports are very welcome and encouraged!

Check the issue tracker for known issues. Due to rapid development, bugs happen
especially as there is functionality which has not yet been developed.

## Development / Building

This requires Go 1.23 or better is installed. You also need `make`.

```bash
# Build
make
# Run
./dingo
```

You can also run the code without building a binary, first
```bash
go run ./cmd/dingo/
```
