# Release Notes

## v0.22.1 (March 8, 2026)

**Title:** Stability updates and polish

**Date:** March 8, 2026

**Version:** v0.22.1

Hi folks! Here’s what we shipped in v0.22.1.

{
  "✨ What's New": [
    "The documentation now makes it easier to understand how to use and deploy the project, and it clearly warns against using it in production environments."
  ],
  "💪 Improvements": [
    "The system can now handle higher event throughput with fewer slowdowns under load.",
    "Queue sizing is now more consistent so performance doesn’t degrade due to undersized configuration defaults.",
    "Implausible-tip detection is now more accurate and safer around edge-case arithmetic.",
    "Automated tests are now less flaky on slower machines and CI runners."
  ],
  "📋 What You Need to Know": [
    "You may need to explicitly set the API bind address in your configuration instead of relying on an implicit default.",
    "Release packaging and CI builds are now using updated, pinned tooling for better supply-chain safety and reproducibility.",
    "Release documentation has been updated so you can review what changed in the latest versions."
  ],
  "🔧 Fixes": [
    "Epoch processing is now more resilient so it can recover rather than stopping when some reference data is missing.",
    "Concurrent rollbacks are now less likely to crash the process.",
    "Epoch cache updates are now safer under concurrency to reduce the risk of corrupted state.",
    "Transaction validation is now more consistent so invalid transactions still get the expected ledger checks."
  ]

## v0.22.0 (March 7, 2026)

**Title:** Mithril bootstrap, built-in APIs, and block production

**Date:** March 7, 2026

**Version:** v0.22.0

Hi folks! Here’s what we shipped in v0.22.0.

### ✨ What's New

- **Mithril bootstrap:** Node operators can now bootstrap a Dingo node from a Mithril snapshot and have the ledger state imported automatically (see “Fast Bootstrapping with Mithril” in `README.md`).
- **Built-in HTTP APIs:** You can run Dingo with built-in, configurable HTTP APIs for common ecosystem compatibility.
- **Block production:** Block production is now supported with Praos leader election and keystore-backed key management.
- **Lifecycle events:** The node now emits richer on-chain lifecycle events that applications can subscribe to.
- **Conway governance metadata:** Governance and Conway-era features are now available in the on-chain metadata pipeline.
- **Leios mode:** A new “leios” mode is available for early experimentation with Leios protocols.
- **Stake snapshots:** Stake snapshots and stake distribution are now available with persistence and querying.

### 💪 Improvements

- **Faster catch-up validation:** Syncing is now faster and safer by reducing unnecessary validation during initial catch-up.
- **Tiered storage and caching:** Block and transaction storage can now be tuned for performance and cost with tiered storage and caching options.
- **Rollback and resync:** Rollback and resync behavior is more robust under forks and stalled peers.
- **Peer management:** Network and peer management now scales more predictably under load.
- **Mempool resilience:** Transaction processing is more resilient and configurable under pressure.
- **Observability:** Observability has been expanded across sync, forging, and storage.
- **Time and nonce handling:** Epoch, slot, and nonce handling better matches Cardano semantics and edge cases.
- **Docs:** Developer and operator documentation has been significantly expanded.

### 🔧 Fixes

- **Chainsync stability:** Chainsync is more reliable around header/block fetching and coordination.
- **Concurrency safety:** Several concurrency and event-delivery deadlocks and goroutine leak risks have been eliminated.
- **Security hardening:** Security hardening has been added for configuration, filesystem usage, and key material.
- **Protocol validation:** Cryptographic and protocol-validation correctness has been tightened across eras.
- **Object-store key encoding:** Storage key encoding issues in object stores have been resolved.

### 📋 What You Need to Know

- **Event consumers:** If you rely on event type strings, update consumers to match the renamed event type strings.
- **API storage backfill:** If you enable API storage or new tiered storage modes, run a metadata backfill so queries return complete results.
- **Forging setup:** If you enable forging, double-check VRF/KES/OpCert key paths and permissions first.

### 🙏 Thank You

Thank you for trying!
